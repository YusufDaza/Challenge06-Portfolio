# World Weather 5-Day Dashboard

## Description

### What was your motivation?

- The motivation behind building the weather dashboard was to provide users with a convenient and intuitive way to access current and future weather conditions for cities or interest.

### Why did you build this project?

- The project was built to fulfill the need for a weather dashboard that allows users to retrieve real-time weather data for cities worldwide. By leveraging third-party APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap API, developers can access accurate weather information and present it to users in a visually appealing format.

### What problem does it solve?

- Instead of relying on multiple sources or applications to obtain weather information, users can utilize a single dashboard to search for cities, view current conditions, and access future forecasts. This streamlines the process of obtaining weather updates and enhances user experience.

### What did you learn?

- Through building the weather dashboard, developers gain experience in working with third-party APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript operations, dynamically updating HTML and CSS based on user input, and implementing functionality such as search history and interactive elements.
